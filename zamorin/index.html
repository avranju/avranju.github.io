<p>Maharaja Manavikraman Kuttunni Raja</p>
<p>When he took over the reign in the year 1915, the Zamorin's College was opened to all sections of the society, which shows his farsightedness and the value he attributed to education. This action paved the way for social upliftment and equal opportunity to all sections of the society.</p>
<p>As we are approaching the centenary of Malabar rebellion of 1921 it is necessary to revisit this historic events from a broader perspective. The khilafat movement which started against the british rule unfortunately took an ugly turn of religious fanatism, riot against hindu community of Eranad taluk coming under the province of Kozhikode Zamorin. Forceful conversions, acquisition of properties and vandalism of place of worship etc. under the name of khilafat were reported by many historians. The role of Zamorin who ruled Kozhikode during those difficult days is worth mentioning here. </p>
<p>The 1921 malabar rebellion started during his reign. This period could be remembered only with deep fear and distress. No one who have gone through those fearful days would be alive today.</p>
<p>Britishers ruled southern part of india with their headquarters at Madras by giving limited powers to the kings of the province. Within his limited powers Zamorin had done many good deeds to the people. </p>

<p>Refugees </p>
<p>The riot and looting at Eranad taluk resulted in large scale infulx of refugees to Kozhikode. Zamorin kept the Kovilakam (palace) doors open to thousands of refugees who fled from Ernad taluk during the riot giving them food &amp; shelter for months. Apart from this, two more camps were opened in kozhikode town one at Puthiyara &amp; the other at Mooriyad. During this period when malabar was going through its dark phase, these yeomen services made a mark in peoples mind for his care and kindness to the poor and needy. </p>

<p><strong>Captain McEnroy</strong></p>
<p>Leinster Regiment was under Capt. Mc Enroy. His role was worth to be mentioned in bringing peace to the Eranad region of Malabar. This brave officer was known for his systematic, fearless moves and had the uncanny skill in co-ordinating many forces with astute precision. He won the heart of Hindu society. Many say that, if at all any Hindus left in Eranad it was just because of this brave officer and he got special mention in all the prominent historical books written on Malabar rebellion.</p>

<p>Guruvayur Sri Krishna Temple</p>

<p>Zamorin on becoming Mel-Etam of Guruvayur Temple, fought with the surviving Mallisseri Karanavar for getting upper hand in the managment of the Temple. This was an interesting feature in the administrative history of the temple. A temporary truce was however patched up when the Madras High Court declared that the <em>uralma</em> right was favourably vested with Zamorin &amp; Mallisseri. This was later confirmed by the legislature and incorporated into law. Once again the quarrel between the two (1889) led to temporary suspension of Pujas and closure of the temple for a week. This resulted in a stalemate in the temple administration. The court assumed managment of Zamorins Estate immediately in 1916 and Sir Henry Cotton the then collector of Malabar was entrusted to manage the temple on behalf of Court of Wards. With the rendition of the estate in 1928 the Guruvayur Temple once again came under the Zamorin. The debt accumulated to the Temple during the court of wards rule had been paid from his privy purse. The Hindu Religious Endowment Board constituted by the HRE Act of 1926 deprived Mallisseri of their right to function as the hereditory trustee of the temple and entrusted the day to day management of the Temple solely to Zamorin. This won laurels among the royal family.</p>
<p>It was during his reign the famous Ekadasi Vilakku Pooja was started at the Guruvayur Srikrishna Temple. The first vilakku was of Sri. Parambot Achutha Menon, son in law of the Zamorin. For the past 100 years this Puja is offered to Lord Guruvayurappan by Parambot family without break.</p>
<p>Apart from historically important Guruvayur many temples are under Kovilakom. Some of them are Thriprangode Shiva Temple, Alathiyur Hanuman Temple, Thirunnavaya Nava Mukunda Temple, Varakkal Bhagavathi Temple, Kozhikode Thali Maha Deva Temple, Valayanad Devi Temple etc.</p>
<p>Being a social reformer, he strived for communal harmony too. He was instrumental of building a Mosque at Vattakinar – Beypore Road (Cemetery Mosque) which brought him wide appreciation among the muslim community in Kozhikode.</p>
<p>A new palace (Puthan Kovilakom) was built at Meenchanda during his reign. This place is now occupied by NSS Higher Secondary School and Government Arts and Science College.</p>

<p>On 20<sup>th</sup> July 1928 Maharaja Manavikraman Kuttunni Raja left to heavenly abode at Thiruvachira Kovilakom, Kozhikode. Vengalil Vilakkumadathil (Manakavu Thavazhy) Lakshmi Amma was his wife. The decsendants of this thavazhy is living at Vengalil, M.N.Road, Chalapuram, Kozhikode. </p>
